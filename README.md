# Air-Traffic-Control-System
Technological developments should be used to improve human living standards and air transportation as well. The world of aviation is closing the world's distance which makes it easier for many people to go to various places around the globe. For safety matters, a safe distance will be determined that must be met by each plane to avoid conflict. Complexity is the amount of workload carried out by Air Traffic Controller based on the number of potential conflicts in a sector in the airspace. Using the number of planes and the safety distance, the complexity of a sector in airspace can be calculated. The complexity of the sectors in the air space will be sought with three conditions, namely at any one instant time, during any interval of time, and a particular time of day.
